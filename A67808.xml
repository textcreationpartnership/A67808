            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And they ſaw him darkly through ſacrifices, and ordinances, and ceremonies, which were but ſhadowes of things to come: but the ſubſtance is Chriſt; and they were not to depend upon their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed the Lord to lead them in this dark way, ſhewing himſelfe to them by degrees, as was moſt to his glory: yet there was more light ſhewed to them then was revealed before them in the Prophets.

               <p>Thus they waited a long time, having but a little hope of him, ſtill looking for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh, and deſiring his comming, and yet willing to wait his time. And at the the laſt he did come, and finiſh all things, for the ſalvation of their ſoules, and made full ſatisfaction to his Father for all ſins, and not for theirs only, but for the ſins of the whole world; for all that was from <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of the world.

So God ſent his only Sonne out of his boſome to take our nature upon him: and he was able to make full ſatisfaction to his Father for all man-kind at once.

               <p>For the firſt, Chriſt hath fulfilled the whole Law for us. Man was commanded to doe it: and there was a great curſe lay upon him if he did not doe it. <hi>Curſed is every one that doth not all things that are written in the book of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</hi> Jam. 2.10. And man, he could not doe it: ſo Chriſt he comes and performes the whole law perfectly for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets? I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill. For verily I ſay unto you, till heaven and earth paſſe, one jot or tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law till all be fulfilled.</hi> And Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that believeth: and he hath fulfilled every jot and tittle of the Law for us; for he did undertake to fulfill the whole Law for us, to purchaſe a perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for us by his fulfilling the Law for us. It behoves us ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> And which of you can taxe me of ſin: ſo his righteouſneſſe is a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there is not any imperfection in it, the Lord hath not any thing to ſay againſt it: and this is for us, Chriſt our righteouſneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:37884:27"/>1.30. <hi>Ye are in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and redemption.</hi> Thus Chriſt hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the whole Law for us.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you how Chriſt hath made full ſatisfaction to his Father for our ſins: and that he did by ſuffering the whole wrath of God for the ſins of the whole world. <hi>I have a baptiſme to be baptized withall,</hi> and how am I ſtreightned till it be accompliſhed? which was his ſuffering. He was to drinke off that bitter cup of the whole wrath of God, wrung out by the hand of Gods vengeance, &amp; to drink the dregs of it for our ſinnes that was laid upon him. And now you ſhall ſee how Chriſt complaines of this wrath of God that lay ſo heavy upon him, <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now is my ſoule troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Father ſave me from this houre? but for this cauſe came I unto this houre.</hi> Matth. 26.38. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, my ſoule is very heavy, even unto the death.</hi> So hee went and fell on his face, and prayed, ſaying, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me: nevertheleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> And thus he prayed 3. times. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>And being in an agony, hee prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling downe to the ground.</hi> How unwilling was the humanity of Chriſt to ſuffer

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37884:57"/>for out of him God is an enemie to us: but in him, God is as well pleaſed with us as he is with Chriſt; for through him wee have free paſſage to goe to God: and <hi>Paul</hi> prizes the knowledge of Chriſt above all things in the world. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea, doubtleſſe I count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things: and do count them but dung that I might winne Chriſt, and be found in him,</hi> For to know Ieſus Chriſt, is to know al things; <hi>for we cannot know him as he is:</hi> but we ſhal know what we are in him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation in the knowledge of him.

               <p>I Having done mine endeavor to ſhew you the right meaning of ſome things in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are ready to ſtumble at: and now there will be a plaine way to walke in. Chriſt himſelfe doth leade us gently, as we are able to goe, teaching us by degrees: and hee is very carefull of thoſe that are but babes in him: thoſe that the ſeede of himſelfe doth but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare in them, and that but in a ſmall meaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.10. <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come with power, and his arme ſhall rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He ſhall feede his flocke like a Shepheard, be ſhall gather the lambs with his arme, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently leade thoſe that are with young.</hi> Chriſt compareth his Church to a flock of ſheep, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.31. <hi>And

Hee ſaith, <hi>I will feede my flocke, and I will cauſe them to lye downe, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Peter; loveſt thou me, feede my ſheepe.</hi> And again he ſaid, <hi>loveſt thou mee, feede my lambes,</hi> John 21.15, 16.</p>
               <p>In a ſheepe-fold there is ſheepe and lambes, and them that are with young, and Chriſt is the Shepherd over them all, and feedes them all with that good paſture which is himſelfe. I ſhall firſt ſhew you how gently he leads them that are with yong; that is, thoſe that hath the ſeed of the ſpirit of Chriſt but conceived in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that but in a ſmal meaſure, that it doth not appeare whether there is any thing or no, neither by thee nor others; which is the firſt degree of the growth of his ſeede in us, which are ſome deſirings after God; The Lord will feed and nouriſh theſe motions in us: <hi>The Lord will not quench the ſmoaking flaxe,</hi> Iſa. 42.3. If there be any deſiring after him, though it be in the ſmalleſt meaſure as can be, and it lies ſmoaking in us, and doth not burne; yet there is fire in it, or elſe it would not ſmoake. God is called fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. And this deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after God, is the Spirit of God in us; for there is nothing that can really deſire after God but that which is one with him; therfore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37884:82"/>it is a ſpirituall fire, and hee will not quench theſe motions in us, though they are but ſmal: and though they are like ſparks of fire in us, he layes them together, and blows them with the wind of his Spirit, and kindles this fire of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in us, that it ſhall flame forth in a viſible appearance to us and others. It may lye hid a while, being covered with the filthineſſe of our fleſh, ſinne and wickedneſſe; or with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our fleſh, our righteouſneſſe: and both theſe are great enemies to him, and ſo lye in us as if it were dead: but the Lord wil quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it, and it ſhall flouriſh: And though Chriſt is but conceived in us, and theſe deſires after him encreaſeth more &amp; more: ſo in the womb of our deſires after him, hee growes more and more: and yet we doe not find that this childe Jeſus is brought forth in us by his Spirit, ſo that wee can perceive it by the enjoyment of thoſe comforts that wee expect to have in him by the manifeſtation of himſelfe in us when we are thus bigge with young: and this childe is come to the birth, and there wants nothing but ſtrength to bring it forth. The Lord is then our leader, and the Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in telling us by ſome inward motions of his Spirit, that the manifeſtation of himſelf ſhall be brought forth to us in his time, and he doth up-hold us in the mean time: but we are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37884:83"/>much troubled, while Chriſt is brought forth to us, that we may ſee him, and rejoyce in him <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>Like as a woman with childe that draweth neer the time of her delivery, is in paine, and cryeth out in her pangs; ſo have wee beene in thy ſight, O Lord. We have beene with child, we have beene in paine, wee have as it were brought forth winde.</hi> We cannot bring forth this childe Jeſus in our own ſtrength; for all our ſtrength is as a blaſt of wind: and the more we ſtrive in our own ſtrength, the more pain we are in: and the nearer he is to be brought forth to us, the more ſpirituall paine wee have of wounds in conſcience, and troubles of minde: but when the child Jeſus is brought forth in us, then we forget that paine, for joy that Chriſt Jeſus is brought forth to us, and all our pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is ſwallowed up in the enjoyment of him: and the longer it is before wee have the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, the more we ſhall prize it when we have it. Therefore be not diſcouraged, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, or whatſoever thou art, that haſt not Chriſt yet brought forth in the; for this ſeed lies hid before it appear: and though there is but ſmall appearance of it in us yet, then it grows in us, and makes way for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of himſelfe to us. And when this ſpirituall childe Jeſus is brought forth in us, which he calls his lambs: and he carries them
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37884:83"/>in his boſome; they are neare and deare unto him. We are not only in his boſome, but hee carries us about with him: we cannot goe, we are ſo weak that we can neither ſtand nor goe; one that is new borne, and therefore wee have yet no ſtrength: We are moſt careful and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our children when they are young ones, and feede them accordingly: and the younger they are, the more tender wee are of them, which doth ſet forth in ſome meaſure the love of God to thoſe that are babes in him. Our love is imperfect, but his love to us is perfect; he cannot forget us, wee lye in his boſome, yea, in the very heart of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Lord brings us from one thing to another; from <hi>Papacie</hi> to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> from <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> to <hi>Independency,</hi> and the Lord is in every one of theſe formes to his people while hee brings them out of it: and Sathan alſo doth transforme himſelfe to an Angel of light, and will be in that form to you; for now you are out of an Anti-chriſtian way, and thinke your ſelves ſafe: but you may hug and embrace <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:37884:102"/>in the myſtery, when you hate him, &amp; ſpeak againſt him in the hiſtory: and the more glorious form you are in, the more ſecure you thinke your ſelves; and are ready to ſay, let us here build Tabernacles. And beloved, wee make goodly Images to our ſelves; the more glorious our forme is, the more glorious ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we make: and the more liker God, the more dangerous; for that which is not purely of God, ſo far as it is not of God, it is of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> and we make an image of it, and that which is like Chriſt; for <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in us like Chriſt, we doe not know him from Chriſt; therefore let not any of us deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe each other, or undervalue one another, for <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> doth tyrannize over us all, ſome in one way, and ſome in another, and hee it is that cauſeth us to deſpiſe and undervalue one another; for that which is of God is loving and kind to all, and meeke and milde, and cauſeth us to forgive one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare one another, and overcome one another with love. When Chriſt comes and breaks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen another ſeal to you, then you will ſee that yet you are in the darke; for that light which now you have, is a great light to that which you ſaw before: but it is but darkneſſe to that light which ſhall appeare to you: and then hee will ſhew you that a great deale of that in you

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> How God brings his Church into the wilderneſſe.</head>
               <p>THere is a ſpirituall wilderneſſe that Chriſt brings his Saints into, before hee giveth them a full poſſeſſion of Canaan, that is, that glorious inheritance, which is Chriſt. A wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe is a barren place; he will ſtrippe us of all our excellent things, ſo far as it is not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelfe; hee will come with the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde, and nip, and deaden, and blaſt all our moſt excellent performances, that wee ſhall have nothing to truſt to, but ſee our ſelves in a barren condition like a wilderneſs. The church of God hath been in the wilderneſſe ever ſince <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> began to reigne: and <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> is that which is like Chriſt, yet oppoſeth Chriſt, and it began in the Apoſtles dayes; for no ſooner is there any thing of Chriſt made known, but the Devill will transforme himſelfe as like it as may be, and labour to ſet up his way in us, and oppoſeth the way of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>For every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37884:103"/>God: and this is that ſpirit of</hi> Anti-chriſt <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have heard, that it ſhould come, and even now already it is in the world,</hi> 1 John 4.3. <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children it is the laſt time: and as ye have heard that</hi> Anti-chriſt <hi>ſhall come; even now there are many</hi> Anti-chriſts, <hi>whereby wee know that it is the laſt times,</hi> 1 John 2.18. That which doth deny Chriſt any other ways in the hiſtory, or in the myſterie, in what manner ſoever it be, ſo farre as wee hold any thing that is not the pure truth of Chriſt, ſo farre as it is not truth it is of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> though it appeare never ſo glorious: and it is ſaid that there are many <hi>Anti-chriſts,</hi> becauſe hee appeareth in many wayes to us: but he did not reigne in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time ſo as he hath done ſince; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was then purely preached: but Chriſt told his Diſciples what things ſhould come to paſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.15. <hi>When yee therefore ſhall ſee the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of deſolation ſpoken of by</hi> Daniel <hi>the Prophet, ſtand in the holy place? whoſo readeth, let him underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord openeth our eyes, that wee ſee it before us, and in us, then wee come to read and underſtand, that the abhomination of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> being ſet up, makes the truth of Jeſus Chriſt deſolate; for that light that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Apoſtles dayes hath beene quite put out, and the Church hath been led in a very
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37884:103"/>darke way; for the minde of God hath beene ſealed up with ſeven ſeales: and all the time that the booke is ſealed up, the Church is in the wilderneſſe, and there ſhee hath a place prepared of God, and there ſhe ſhould be fed a thouſand, two hundred and threeſcore days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.26. And this was the time of the two Witneſſes propheſying. <hi>And I will give power unto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie a thouſand, two hundred, and threeſcore dayes cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in ſack-cloath,</hi> Rev. 11.3.</p>
               <p>God hath ſome alwayes to ſpeake forth his pure truth in ſome meaſure: and they that ſpeake forth the things of Chriſt, are the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Chriſt, and they propheſie in ſacke-cloath; which ſigne of ſorrow and mourning when there is but little manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt, then we are kept under by <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> both outward and inward, and then is the time of mourning. <hi>Can the children of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber faſt while the Bride-groom is with them? but when the Bride-groom is taken from them, in thoſe dayes ſhall they faſt.</hi> And when they faſted, they uſed to be cloathed in ſack-cloath, which doth appeare that the time of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſſe, having then but ſmall appearance of the Bride-groom to them, then is the time of faſting and mourning, yet God doth feed and preſerve her from all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37884:104"/>beaſts that are in the wilderneſſe: and there are ſeven degrees of comming out of this wilderneſſe, and the Lord doth firſt ſhew us that we are in the wilderneſſe, before hee doth make it known to us that hee hath brought us out of it; hee will ſhew us our barrenneſſe by ſtripping us quite naked of all our goodly things, that we ſhall have nothing to truſt too, then will he reveale himſelfe in us, and appear to be all in all in us, and then he will appeare very glorious, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will bring her into the wilderneſſe, and ſpeake comfortably unto her.</hi> There is firſt a dying to the fleſh, before there is appearing to live in the Spirit; for while our firſt husband, (the law or fleſh) is alive, we live unto him: but if he be dead by the life of Chriſt appearing in us, then we are free to marry to another, which is to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. We are dead to the fleſh by the power of the death of Chriſt; for Chriſt dyed for the deſtruction, I doe not meane our bodies, but that which is of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> in us: <hi>and our life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> for our life is in the life of Chriſt. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the life that I now live in the fleſh</hi> (which is in the body) <hi>I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. But in the beginning of this verſe, he ſaith, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> Gal.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37884:104"/>6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto mee, and I unto the world.</hi> So we are crucified to all things that is below Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>Wherefore hence-forth know we no man after the fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow hence-forth know we him ſo no more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man bee in Chriſt hee is a new creature; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lde things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt not know Chriſt any longer after our fleſhly apprehenſion; for all our old ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of Chriſt muſt paſſe away by the new manifeſtations of Chriſt in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſinne: but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you: hee that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a dying to the fleſh, and then living to thee Spirit; <hi>It is aPpointed for man once to dye.</hi> And after death, comes the judgement, as all things is, and ſhall be fulfilled outwardly in the hiſtory; ſo all things ſhall be fulfilled ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in us in the miſtery. Chriſt is riſen in us, and is come to ſpirituall judgment, and doth raiſe up his Spirit in us, that hath lyen as it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37884:105"/>were dead in us: and the fleſh (which is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſtand before God, and be judged and condemned by him,</hi> Col. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall yee alſo appeare with him in glory: and we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3.2. <hi>Bleſſed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,</hi> Revel. 20.6.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt reſurrection, and the Lord is ſet in his judgement-ſeate to deſtroy <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. And then ſhall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his comming: Even him whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, and lying wonders,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Satan is ſaid to ſit in heavenly places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he transformeth himſelfe to the likeneſſe of God, and ſo deceiveth us, making us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is God, and ſo we worſhip him, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee is God. How art thou fallen from heaven, O <hi>Lucifer,</hi> Son of the Morning? how art thou cut down to the ground, which didſt weaken the Nations? For thou haſt ſaid in thy heart, I will aſcend into heaven, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt my Throne above the Stars of God: I will ſit alſo upon the mount of the Congregation in the ſides of the North. I will aſcend above the height of the clouds, I will be like the moſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37884:105"/>High. Yet thou ſhalt be brought down to hell ſo the ſides of the pit. They that ſee thee ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did ſhake Kingdomes? That made the world as a wilderneſſe, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cities thereof, that opened not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So hee carried mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the Spirit into the Wilderneſſe, and I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven heads and tenne bornes. And the woman was arraied in purple, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earlet, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her handfull of abhominations, and filthineſſe of her fornication. And I ſaw the woman drunke with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:37884:106"/>Revel. 17. All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.3. Here is a diſcovering of Anti-chriſt before ſhe is judged, condemned, and deſtroyed: and when the time is come for the diſcovering of her to us, then hee ſhewes us her by a high and glorious revelation of himſelf; for there is not any thing that can diſcover Anti-chriſt to us, but the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>When the Lord doth come to ſhew us any thing of himſelfe in the myſtery, he ſaith, <hi>come up hither, and I will ſhew you the things that muſt be hereafter: and immediately I was in the Spirit,</hi> Rev. 4.1. Rev. 1.10. Rev. 17.1. Rev. 21.9. There is no ſeeing of any thing of God in the truth of it, but by the revelation of the Spirit of God, and hee carrieth us as wee are Saints up into himſelfe: and the higher hee carrieth us, the more he ſhews us of the myſterie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for as hee openeth the ſeales in making known any thing of himſelfe to us, hee ſaith, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> Rev. 4.12. <hi>After this I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and behold, a doore was open in heaven: and the firſt voyce which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which ſaid,</hi> Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things that muſt be hereafter. <hi>And immediately I was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and behold, a Throne was ſet in heaven, and one ſate on the Throne.</hi> And being in the Spirit
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37884:106"/>he comes to ſee it; then after hee hath ſhowne himſelfe to us, he ſhows us <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> which is called the great Whore, becauſe we all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſpirituall fornication with her: and here is a carrying us up higher in the Spirit to ſee her. And there came one of the ſeven Angels which had the ſeven Vials, and talked with me, and ſaying unto me, <hi>Come hither, I will tell thee the myſtery of the woman, and of the beaſt that carryeth her: &amp; I will ſhew unto thee the judgement of the great Whore,</hi> Rev. 17.17. And then after he hath ſhewed us the myſterie of the Whore, and her deſtruction, then he ſhews us the marriage of the Church to Chriſt in the myſterie, &amp; in his glory. And there came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me one of the ſeven Angels, which had the ſeven vials full of the ſeven laſt plagues, and talked with me, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Come hither, I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambs wiſe. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountaine, and ſhewed me that great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcending out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God, having the glory of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>So we are carried up higher and hiher into God by the Spirit of God, revealing the things of God in us: and when the Spirit of God doth ſhew us God ſitting upon his Throne in his glory, in ſuch a meaſure as we are enabled
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37884:107"/>to ſee him; then he ſhewes us <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> in his glory, or the Whore in her glory; for it is one and the ſame, as Chriſt and his Church is, Chriſt being the head, and his Church the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: ſo <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> which is the Devill, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to an Angel of light, is the head, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.14. and his ſeede in us all is the body, which is called the Whore, and ſhe doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare very glorious. <hi>And the woman was arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in purple, and ſcarlet-colour, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls,</hi> Rev. 17.4. like the church of God, the Lambs wife: and without the Spirit of God doth ſhew us the difference betwixt her and the Church of God, we do not know her from the Church of God, for ſhe is in the wilderneſſe where the Church of God is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. <hi>So he carried me in the Spirit into the wilderneſſe, and I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, having ſeven heads, and ten horns.</hi> By ſeeing the beaſt that ſhe ſitteth upon, which doth beare her up, and this beaſt doth aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.7. Wee come to know her from the Church of God. <hi>And there appeared a great wouder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars. And ſhe being with child, crying, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in birth, and pained to be delived.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:37884:107"/>
               <p>This woman is the Church of God, and is ſaid lo be in heaven, that is, in Chriſt; for hee is the perfect heaven: and ſhe is cloathed with Chriſt, which is the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, and all things that are below him, is under her feete. And ſhe hath a crowne of twelve ſtars, the glory of Chriſt, that did appeare by that Doctrine that was taught by the twelve Apoſtles of Chriſt; for the Preachers of the Goſpel are called ſtars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. Shee hath the glory of Chriſt, and is cloached with him, and he is with her, and in her, yet ſhe ſaw it not; hee had not manifeſted himſelfe to her. She was as it were with childe with him, and in great paine, deſiring to have him brought forth to her, that ſhee mighe ſee him as hee is, and have the enjoyment of him: and no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did this woman appear, but there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another wonder in heaven. <hi>And behold, a great red Dragon, having ſeven heads, and tenne bornes, and ſeven crowns upon his head, and hee ſtood before the Woman which was ready to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for to devoure her childe as ſoone as it was delivered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> labours to devoure Chriſt as ſoon as he is brought forth in us, appearing to us like unto Chriſt. <hi>And there was warre in heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels ſought againſt the Dragon, and the Dragon ſought, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37884:108"/>and prevailed not, neither was their places found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent, called the Devill and Satan, which deceives the whole world, hee was caſt out into the earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the Devill made known to us how he is in heavenly places, fighting againſt Chriſt: but Chriſt hath overcome him, and caſt him out of his heavenly ſhape, that hee ſhall not be able to overcome us. He is called a red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, becauſe hee perſecutes and deſtroyes the Church of God: and this Beaſt is ſpoken of in many places of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> and the woman that ſits upon it is the glory and ſeeming excellency of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;</hi> and ſhe alſo is cloathed with ſcarlet-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is perſecution. Though ſhee be cloathed in the moſt glorious manner as can be, with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls, like the glory of Chriſt, yet this is but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. <hi>And ſhe hath in her hand a golden cup full of abhominations, and filthineſſe of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Being ſhee appeares ſo glorious to us, like unto Chriſt: and the cup that ſhee giveth us to drinke of appeareth ſo pure and glorious, which maketh us not to queſtion it, but thinke that it is the cup of ſalvation: So we drinke of her abhominationr, and commit ſpiritual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37884:108"/>with her: and ſhe ſitteth upon all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; multitudes, and tongues, and nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. Shee domineereth over us all, and ſhe is carried on ſwiftly in her abominations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the backe of the Beaſt which was full of names of blaſphemie, which blasphemeth the name of God, and ways of God. And he hath ſeven heads, perfection of wiſdome; he knows all the wayes of God, and hee transformeth himſelfe to the likentſſe of them all: And hee hath tenne hornes to perſecute withall, and he makes uſe of them ſo farre as God ſuffereth him: and he hath all wayes to decive us in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like a Lamb to us, having two hornes like a Lamb, but ſpeaking like a Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. and alſo appearing like Prophets in us, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>And I ſaw three uncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, like frogs, comming out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet. For they are the ſpirit of Devills, working miracles.</hi> And the Lord doth make the wayes of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> appeare, laying them clearly open by the appearance of himſelfe in us: and as he breaks open the ſeals to us, there are great earth-quakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>Yet once more, I ſhake not only the earth, but alſo heaven.</hi> And this word <hi>(yet once more)</hi> ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37884:109"/>things which cannot be ſhaken, may remaine.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37884:113"/>vail that doth keepe us from the ſeeing of him. <hi>Moſes</hi> after he had ſeen, and talked with God, he appeared ſo glorious, that the people could not looke upon him, and then he put a vail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his face. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a type of Chriſt, and hee had a vaile over him, that they could not ſee him, which were types and ſhadowes: and through that vaile they ſaw Chriſt darkely, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Seeing we have ſuch hope we uſe great plaineſſe of ſpeech. And not as</hi> Moſes <hi>which put a vaile over his face, that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly looke to the end of that which is aboliſhed?

But even unto this day when</hi> Moſes <hi>is read, the vaile is upon their hearts. Nevertheleſſe, when it ſhall turne to the Lord, the vaile ſhall be taken away.</hi> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. When the Lord doth open the ſeales to us, and comes with power in us by his Spirit, then hee turnes us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſhewes us by degrees that this vaile that hinders us from ſeeing him, is taken away by him, and ſo by degrees we ſhall ſee him as he is; and then we ſhall ſeee what bondage we were in to ſin and Satan, and our owne ſelves, and how wee are ſet at liberty by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi>

Now as he manifeſts himſelfe in us, he ſwallows up this death, and wee ſhall ſee our ſelves live in his life, and dead to that life that wee did live to our ſelves. Thus the Lord will ſtrip us of all our excellent things, bringing us into the wilderneſſe, and ſhewing us that all our works are burnt up, ſo far as they are of us: but that which is of God in us, is not burnt up, but is purged from our droſſe, and will appeare very glorious, and will make us ſilent; for we ſhall have nothing to boaſt of, but confeſſe that it is Chriſt in us which is that glory; then we ſhal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And he ſaid unto me, write, <hi>bleſſed are they that are called to the marrioge ſupper of the Lamb.</hi> And he ſaid unto me, <hi>Theſe are the true ſayings of God,</hi> Rev. 20.9, 10, 11. <hi>And there came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee one of the ſeven Angels, and talked with me, and ſaid unto me,</hi> Come hither, and I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambes Wife. <hi>And hee carried mee away in the Spirit to a great and high mountaine, and ſhewed mee that great Citie, the holy</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>deſcending out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God, having the glory of God. And her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a Jaſper ſtone, clear as chryſtall.</hi>

               <p>The Bride of Chriſt is the Church of God, and it is deſcended out of Heaven from God, for it is one with him; for it is the Spirit of God in all the children of God, that is this body, the Church. The Bride and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth

Pſalm 28.7. <hi>Hee hath cloathed us with his ſtrength:</hi> And this is that beautifull garment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. For behold, the darkeneſſs ſhall cover the earth, and groſſe

               <p>The Spouſe of Chriſt being cloathed with the glory of Chriſt, ſhee is all glorious. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within.</hi> Wee are the King of heavens daughters, for wee are married to Chriſt, and God the Father is our Father, and wee are all glorious within.</p>
               <p>It is the Spirit of God in us that is ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and this is a ſpirituall glory, it cannot be ſeene outwardly by others; they may hear us ſpeake forth ſomething of this glory in us, but none ſees it nor knowes it, but thoſe that have it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth will I give to eate of the hidden Manna: and I will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him that hath it.</hi>

               <p>This Manna is Chriſt, and he is hid from the world, but as wee are Saints, wee ſee it, and feede upon it; for it is that which wee live by, and this ſtone is Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. And this is a very precious ſtone: and here is a new name written in this ſtone, that none doth know it but hee that hath it. And that which is written in it is the manifeſtation of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37884:117"/>the exceeding riches of the love and mercy of God, and all his glory and excellency which hee hath given us as we are Saints.</p>

Thou haſt raviſhed my heart my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy necke. How faire is thy love, my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, my Spouſe, how much better is thy love than wine, and the ſmell of thy oyntments, than all ſpices. Thy lips <hi>(O my Love)</hi> drop as the honey-combe; honey and milke are under thy tongue, and the ſmell of thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is like the ſmell of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This oyntment that our Beloved is ſo taken with the ſmell of, is the anoynting of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The anointing which yee have received of him abideth in you, and yee need not that any man teach you: but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things, and is truth, and is no lye: and even as he hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi>

               <p>The Prieſts and Kings uſed to be anoynted with oyle, and it was a type of Chriſt; hee was that King and Prieſt that was anoynted with the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.6, 7. <hi>Thy

               <p>This oyntment of the Spirit of God is all of it poured upon this Prieſt, Chriſt, which is the head of the Church, and it runs off from him down upon all the Saints: and this oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit of God makes our garments ſmell ſo ſweete, which is that Wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. <hi>which is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints,</hi> Revel. 19.8.

And when he lookes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, he is raviſhed with her; that is, hee is overcome with the ſight of her, all his love runneth forth to her. There is not any two lovers upon earth that their love can be ſo great as the love of Chriſt and his Spouſe is one to the other: and ſhe is called forth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Goe forth, O ye daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Sion, <hi>and behold King</hi> Solomon <hi>with the Crowne where-with his mother crowned him in the day of his ſpouſall, and in the day of the gladneſſe of his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt is compared to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe hee had the moſt glory of any King upon the earth: and in the day of Chriſts Eſpouſall, doth his glory appeare to us, and the gladneſſe of his heart, and all is for joy of his marriage to us, and it is his joy for us to behold it: and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37884:121"/>ſhe beholding her beloved in his glory, and ſeeing his love to her, ſhe is alſo raviſhed and wholly overcome, and ſwallowed up in him, in ſeeing him to be her beloved. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his, he feedeth among the lilies,</hi> Cant. 3.16. Chriſt compareth his Spouſe to lilies. <hi>As the lilly among thorns, ſo is my love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the daughters,</hi> Cant. 2.2.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This field is all the world, and the Saints are theſe lillies, and the other are but thornes. Both thoſe that are of the world which is not of Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo that which is in us, which is not of Chriſt, are like thorns to keep theſe lilies from growing, and doe what they can to choak this ſeede of God in us, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are theſe lilies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.7. And ſhe compareth her Beloved to an apple-tree. <hi>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons. I ſate under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt,</hi> Cant. 2.3. He is a tree of life which beareth twelve manner of fruits, <hi>and yieldeth her fruit every moneth,</hi> Revel.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37884:122"/>22.2. And here is all pleaſant fruit upon it, and is never barren: and the fruit of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-tree wee feede upon: and whoſoever hath taſted of this fruit, doth know that it is very pleaſant: and after we have taſted of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe wil content us to feed upon but that, and this tree is a ſhadow and refuge againſt all ſtorms and tempeſts, and here we fit quietly feeding upon him: but hee brings us further, and leads us into his banqueting-houſe that he might feed us with all his dainties, for they are all prepared for us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>He brought me to the banqueting-houſe, and his banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of love. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me.</hi> When he doth feed us with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly dainties, and embraceth us with the arme of his love, we are not able to containe our ſelves; we are ſo raviſhed with him, that we are even ſicke with love: but hee ſtais us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when wee are ſicke for the enjoyment of him, before he doth appeare ſo glorious in us; then he ſtayes us with the flagons of the wine of his Spirit: and of thoſe apples, ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of himſelfe in us, to ſtay and up-hold us.

He doth appear in us ſo ſweets, precious and glorious, that we are not able to containe it; the enjoyment of him fils us ſo with joy, that it makes us ſick, being we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain it: but he doth up-hold us while he doth embrace us, enlarging our veſſell, and ſo filling us. I am my beloveds, and his deſire is to me. <hi>Come my beloved, let us goe forth into the field: let us lodge in the villages.

For all thoſe excellent things that is in him, is for us his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, whether old or new manifeſtations of his glory in us, and all that is in us is for him; like the rivers that comes from the Sea, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37884:123"/>runs to the Sea againe: ſo Chriſt doth fill us with himſelfe: and all theſe ſtreams of himſelf in us doth wholly flow forth to him; We are willing for him to have all the honour, glory, and praiſe; we are ſo deeply in love with him, that we thinke nothing too deare for him. All that is ours is for him; yea, our lives, if he call for them; we are ſorry that we cannot expreſs our love to him as we would; for our bodies are a priſon to us: but all our love is wholly runne forth to him, and his love is the like to us. <hi>Here is perfect love that caſteth out feare,</hi> 1 John 4.18. This is the love that is as ſtrong as death, and it is like fire which hath a moſt vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drowne it: If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would be utterly condemned, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. And our love is made known in a great high meaſure one to the other. Our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is altogether lovely, &amp; more to be deſired than all the things in the world.

               <p>Out of the mouth commeth the full expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that love of Chriſt that is in his heart to us, and by his kiſſing us, which is a very high expreſſion of his love to us. <hi>My beloved it gone downe into his garden: to the beds of ſpices,

               <p>WHen we come to ſee what God hath done for us in Chriſt Jeſus, how hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed this <hi>Babylon</hi> in us, and hath bound Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſwallowed up the vaile that hindered us from ſeeing him: and we come to ſee him, and ſee what we are in him, and how wee are marryed to him. There will be much joy and rejoycing for the deſtruction of our ſpirituall enemie, &amp; for joy of the marriage of the Lamb and the Saints. The finger of God will play upon the wel-ſtringed inſtrument of muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>que, (which is the Spirit of God in us) playing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly tunes, and new ſongs that we never ſung before. For firſt, there is a rejoycing for the manifeſtation of the love of God to us in <hi>Chriſt. He hath made us Kings &amp; Prieſts to God and his Father,</hi> and we ſhall reigne with him for ever. <hi>And I heard a great voyce out of heaven,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe ſhall be with them, and be their God. And God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37884:125"/>paine, for the former things are paſſed away,</hi> Rev. 21.3, 4. The cauſe of our crying and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either for ſpirituall, or for outward things, is becauſe we doe not clearely ſee God what he is to us, and that all that he doth to us is in love: and that hee will have his owne time to bring to paſſe his own will in his owne way, both ſpirituall and temporall, for the glory! of his Name, and for our good; when we come to be really ſenſible of this, then wee ſhall ſee that wee have no cauſe of mourning; then ſhall our teares be wiped from our eyes. <hi>Rejoyce ye with</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and be glad with her all ye that love her; rejoyce for joy with her, all yee that mourne for her,</hi> Iſa. 66.10. <hi>For behold I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate new heavens, and a new earth: and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: for behold I create</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a rejoycing, &amp; her people a joy. And I will rejoyce in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and joy in my people, and the voyce of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voyce of crying,</hi> Iſa. 65.17, 18, 19. And the Lord will cauſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and praiſe to ſpring forth before all the Nations: <hi>and I will direct their work in truth, &amp; I will make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37884:125"/>which the Lord hath bleſſed. I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyfull in my God: for be hath cloathed me with the garments of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee hath covered me with the robe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as a Bride-groom decketh himſelfe with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with jewels:</hi> everlaſting joy ſhall be unto them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. As there are new manifeſtations of God in us: ſo there will be new ſongs of joy and rejoycing in the Lord. <hi>And I heard a voyce from heaven, as the voyce of many waters, and as the voyce of a great thunder: and I heard the voyce of harpers harping with their harps. And they ſang as it were a new ſong before the Throne, and no man could learn that ſong but the hundred and forty, and four thouſand which were redeemed from the earth,</hi> Rev. 14.2, 3. <hi>And I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſs mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his marke, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the ſea of glaſſe, having the harps of God. And they ſung the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb,</hi> ſaying, <hi>great and marvellous are thy workes, Lord God Almighty. Juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints. Who ſhall not feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? for thou only art holy: for all Nations ſhall come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before thee, for thy judgments are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> Revel. 15.2, 3, 4. This ſea of glaſſe is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37884:126"/>Chriſt, and none can ſtand upon him but the Saints; for it is too ſlippery for any other to ſtand upon it, for they will fall: and this fire that is mingled with this glaſſe will burn them up: but here the Saints ſtand with joy, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new ſong, and rejoycing in the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; the joy is beyond expreſſion, none can know it, but they that have the enjoyment of it, to ſee and know that Chriſt hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and deſtroyed all our ſpirituall enemies in us, for he hath thrown down <hi>Babylon</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And after theſe things, I heard a great voyce of much people in heaven,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Allelujah, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and glory, and honour, and power be unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for he hath judged the great Whore which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand. And again they ſaid</hi> Allelujah, <hi>and her ſmoak roſe up for ever and ever. And the four and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the four beaſts fell downe and worſhipped God that ſate upon the Throne,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah. <hi>And a voyce came out of the Thron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37884:126"/>twenty Elders are thought to be the Prophets and Apoſtles; for by them was the minde of God made known: and theſe foure beaſts yee ſhall find ſpoken of in the firſt of <hi>Ezek. Rev.</hi> 4. which was moved by the Spirit of God, and was continually prayſing God. And this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where there is ſuch a noyſe of joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and praiſing God, is the Church of God, here is the ſinging of birds, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.12. Becauſe the voyce of this Turtle, our beloved Bride-groom, our ſweet Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, his ſweet voyce of love and peace to us, and joy and rejoycing in us is heard by us, and wee ſee all things that hath hindered us from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, is deſtroyed by him; for theſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pitchers of Antichriſt in us, wherein the lamps of the light and glory of God lieth hid. Theſe pitchers being broke by Chriſt, then the glory of God appeareth, <hi>Judges</hi> 7. And then the trumpets will ſound forth the praiſes of God; our tongues ſhall be as a trumpet, being blown by the Spirit of God, to ſound forth the praiſes of our God: and this ſound ſhall be heard throughout the whole world; for the Lord will come in his time, and reigne in all his Saints throughout the whole world, and throughout the whole world ſhall this trumpet be ſounded, and it will cauſe a great earth-quake; for all things that are not of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37884:127"/>God, ſhall be exceeding fraid and troubled; for as the Saints joy encreaſeth more and more by Chriſt manifeſting himſelfe in us; ſo ſhall the ſorrow of thoſe that are not the children of God encreaſe more &amp; more. <hi>Rejoyce ye heavens, &amp; ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, &amp; of the ſea, for the Devill is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time,</hi> Rev. 12.12. For the light of theſe lamps, and the ſound of theſe trumpets doth terrifie our ſpirituall enemies, and cauſeth them to flie: and let us doe as the four and twenty Elders did, fall downe at the feete of Chriſt. <hi>And when thoſe beaſts gave glory, and honour, and thankes to him that ſate on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty Elders fell downe before him that ſate on the Throne, and worſhipped him that liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver &amp; ever: and caſt their crowns before the throne,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power: for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Rev. 4.9, 10, 11. Theſe Elders that God had revealed himſelfe unto in ſuch a high and glorious way, and made them inſtruments to make his mind knowne to all people, &amp; crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with his crowne of glory; theſe caſt their Crowns at the feet of God, for it was he in Chriſt that did make knowne his minde by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37884:127"/>them: and as he deſerveth all the honour and praiſe, ſo let us be willing for him to have all the honour; for wee have this treaſure in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. It is he that doth all in us, and let him have all; for it is the glory of the Saints for Chriſt to have all the glory, and for us to be abaſed and caſt downe as low as may be at the feete of Chriſt, and for him alone to be exalted in us. There is one ſeale more to be broke open; for this is the ſixth ſeal, and the firſt reſurrection, and now is Satan bound: but he muſt be again let looſe for a little ſeaſon, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. Hee ſhall have power given him of God, and will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to the likeneſſe of this glory to deceive us: but hee ſhall never have his will of the Saints; for when he thinks to deceive us in this way, the Lord breakes open the ſeventh ſeale; then is the whole myſtery of God made known, and then ſhall the ſeventh trumpet of perfection of joy and rejoycing ſound forth the praiſes of God in the dayes of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall begin to blow the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, even the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as hee hath declared to his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. And now we ſee but in part, and know but in part, and ſo we have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God but in part: but when that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37884:128"/>which is perfect is come, that which is in part ſhall be done away: and now we ſee him but darkly, but then we ſhall ſee him face to face, and behold him as he is in his full glory: and when we come to have this ſeale broke open to us, then we ſhall know when the time is for the breaking of it open, and how it is, &amp; what it is that we ſhall enjoy: and in the mean time let us not be inquiſitive to know when it ſhall be, or how it ſhall be; for wee ſhall not know till then, and then we ſhall know whether it be here while we live in this world, or hereafter, when all things are diſſolved: but let us leave that to God, and to him commit our ſelves, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing always in the Lord.</hi> To whom be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe and glory given, both now, and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
